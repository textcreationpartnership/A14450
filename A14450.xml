            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN Reader, an admonition touching reading.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T falleth out in matter of learning as it doeth in matter of meats. For as in meates, one, &amp; the ſelfe ſame diſh is diuerſly ſet forth, according to the inuention of the dreſſer, and appetite of the eater: ſo in lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, one, and the ſelfe ſame point is diuerſly handled, according to the diſcretion of the writer, and capacitie of the Reader. Hence it commeth that in humane learning, euery writer (almoſt) hath his Grammer, his Rhetoricke, his Logicke, his Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy; and in diuine knowledge, his Catechiſme, his Common places, his Commentaries. Many complaine of this, as a thing which diſtracteth the mind, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the memorie, and hindereth the iudgement. And not without cauſe. For as varietie of meates do cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt in the ſtomacke, and breede ſickeneſſe, rather then preſerue health: ſo variety of treatiſes, vppon one and the ſelfe ſame thing, doth hinder the growth and profiting of diuerſe, in ſoundneſſe of iudgement and godly life. But the reformation hereof, is a worke worthy of all the Churches, Princes, and ſtates in chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome; for the beginning and perfecting where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, priuate men can but pray and wiſh well; and euery man carefully look to the warrant of his own worke. In the mean time let no man condemne, the variety and choiſe of Gods manifold gifts, which both in bodily and ſpirituall thinges, ſet foorth the riches of his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and goodneſſe. What then? Surely the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and vanity of men, who, doe eyther not vſe at all, or elſe greatly abuſe the gifts and bleſſings of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon them. This vanity appeareth partly in the foode of the body, but more ſpecially in the food of the ſoule. <note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. 23.</note> For no man will refuſe his meate except it be in ſome extreame paſſion. Beſides, how carefull are the moſt part in making their prouiſion? how curious in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb facs="tcp:20291:3"/> what is wholeſome or hurtfull for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? how preciſe and conſtant in keeping their hours for dinner &amp; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per? how willing to keep themſelues to ſome few kinds of meat, though they haue often taſted &amp; fed on them before? But touching the food of the ſoule (which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth chiefly in the pure vſe of Gods publick worſhip, and partly in holy praiers, meditations, and readings in priuat) how many do refuſe it as a fruitleſſe &amp; vnſauory thing? And though the moſt part be content, for ſome carnall reſpect, to ſhew themſelues in the publicke aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies: yet who ſhall find a faithfull Chriſtian, that is carefull to redeeme the time, and to make himſelfe, by priuate reading and meditation, more fit to reape fruit by the publicke miniſtery of the word and ſacraments? But know thou (beloued) that as they, who, through er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, preiudice, or ſelf loue, are ſo addicted to their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uat ſtudies that they deſpiſe or neglect the publick mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, ſhall (without ſpeedy mercy from God, fal into diuerſe fond opinions, and dangerous errors, and pine away in their ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; ſins: ſo to little purpoſe is out hearing of ſermons abroad, if there be not a ſetled and conſtant courſe of priuat prayer, reading, meditation, and conference at home. But becauſe my purpoſe is now to ſpeak only of reading, and that very briefly (for the argument is infinit, and I haue ſomewhat touched it elſe where,) <note place="margin">Preface to maſter Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers Sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</note> I would entreat thee Chriſtian reader, and in the Lord Ieſus beſeech thee (if my requeſt may ſeeme reaſonable) that thou wouldſt be as wiſe for thy ſoule as thou art for thy body; as mindfull of the life to come, as thou art of this preſent life; <note place="margin">Four things to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note> and that for this end thou wouldeſt obſerue theſe foure things, as well for the one as for the other. <note place="margin">1 Prouide the beſt bookes.</note> Firſt therefore make thy prouiſion of good books, eſpecially of the booke of all books, I meane the holy Canonicall Scriptures, in that reſpect called the Bible: &amp; then of ſome other, ſuch as are moſt fit for thy calling and capacitiy. And becauſe thou ſhalt want either money to buy, leyſure to reade, iudgement to vnderſtand, or memory to bear away the ſubſtance of al good books, prouide the beſt. Many wil
<pb facs="tcp:20291:3"/> ſay, they find by experience that in meate and apparel the beſt is beſt cheape: and thou ſhalt bee ſure to find, that among bookes the beſt will yeeld moſt fruit to thy ſoule. <note place="margin">2 In chuſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ng vſe the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe of the godly lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> Secondly, becauſe the moſt part are babes in iudgement and diſcerning of ſpirituall things (though euery foole be wiſe in his own eyes) not knowing what is fit &amp; profitable, or what is hurtfull and inconuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: let me intreat thee to aske counſell and aduiſe of the godly learned, eſpecially of thine owne paſtor (if God haue bleſſed thee with an able &amp; faithful ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) <note place="margin">

No wiſe man will receaue a writing for the leaſt plot of ground without the counſaile of ſome learned Lawyer, nor a medicine for his body, without the aduiſe of ſome learned Phiſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and wilt thou ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a booke, wherein may be ſome da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nable error, which may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uay fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee thy heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly inheritance; or ſome deadly poiſon, which may kill the ſoule, without the direction of ſome godly diuine? do it not. <note place="margin">3 Be conſtant in keeping of houres.</note> Thirdly, remember that nothing is more hard, then to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in holy exerciſes. For herein the ſubtiltie and rage of our inuiſible enemie Sathan doth moſt notably ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, herein the frailtie &amp; corruption of fleſh &amp; bloud will bewray it ſelfe. Here profit &amp; pleaſure, buſineſſe, &amp; idleneſſe, matters at home &amp; matters abroad, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, &amp; a thouſand occaſions will lye in our way as ſo many Lions to let &amp; hinder vs. Therefore herein gird vp the loynes of thy mind, put vpon thee the whole armour of God, &amp; dayly renue thy couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of redeeming the time made with God and thy owne conſcience. Thou ſeeſt that men who are moſt greedy of the world, will not miſſe (ſcarce once in a yeare) their ordinary hours of eating and drinking. Why then ſhouldeſt thou be ſo ſickle &amp; vnfaithfull in forgetting &amp; omitting the times of reading and praying vnto God. <note place="margin">4 Read a good booke through, and read it often ouer.</note> Fourthly, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou haſt begun a good booke, giue not ouer till thou haue ended it, &amp; when thou haſt read it ouer once, let it not be tedious vnto thee to read it ouer again &amp; again, for
<pb facs="tcp:20291:4"/> thou ſhalt finde the ſecond reading more fruitfull the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the firſt, &amp; the third more fruitfull then the ſecond, &amp; ſo the oftener the better This is a great vanitie &amp; an euill ſickneſſe among me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that if they haue once ſeene the title of a booke, and the authors name, &amp; read two or three leaues, it is caſt at their heeles for euer after, as if they had attained all that could be learned by it, when they can name the title &amp; author of it.

Here perhaps thou wilt aske what bookes, beſide the holy Bible I would commend vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee: Wherein though I ſee ſome difficultie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it cannot be done without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſons which are cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted odious: yet for thy good I wil not ſpare to ſhew my poore opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: <note place="margin">No one book of the like volume more fruite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell.</note> which is that no one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (that I haue ſeen) hath ſet down the ſumme &amp; grounds of Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Religion more holily &amp; happily, for the capacitie and edifying of all ſortes, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this preſent author. For this cauſe I ſpecially reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend him to thee, as one by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou mayſt ſpecially profit if thou call vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the name of God through Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; bind thy ſelfe to dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; conſtancie: remembring that as one diſh of meate, well chewed &amp; digeſted, will co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort nature more then diuers delicates, that lye raw &amp; vndigeſted in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, ſo one booke often &amp; throughly read wil do thy ſoule more good, then the ſuperficiall fight and taſt of a thouſand.

                  <speaker>Mat.</speaker>
                  <p>This generall we maie marke, that the Church hath alwaies (as it is at this day) beene gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the authoritie of the holy Scripture: that is to ſaie, a companie of men of diuers ages, ſexes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, which worſhippeth God according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:20291:7"/> and doctrine of that Scripture: a good part whereof in all ages hath ſealed the ſame with their bloud. But the ſpeciall or particular effects are, that they rauiſh the reader, &amp; enforce him to the reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God, no otherwiſe then as if God himſelf did ſpeak.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, that by the reading of them, our hearts are touched with an earneſt feeling of our ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>Laſt of all, that they lift vp our minds aboue all hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, kindle within vs a deſire of a better life, &amp; cauſe vs that in compariſon thereof, we do eaſily deſpiſe all other things.</p>
                  <p>All which are not done by the writings of men, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they be artificiallie handled. Therefore the Apoſtle to the Hebrues ſaith, that the word of God is liuing, mightie in operation, and piercing more then anie two edged ſword, and that it doth reach e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12.</note> to the diuiding aſunder of the ſoule and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, of the ioynts and marrow.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
                  <p>Verily theſe are moſt ſtrong arguments, to prooue the truth of Gods word. But there bee ſome which ſay, that all the authority of it dependeth vpon the Church.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mat.</speaker>
                  <p>They do, as if one ſhould ſay, that the light of the ſunne hangeth vpon the teſtimony of men. For as the Sunne ſhall not ceaſe to ſhine, although all men be blind: euen ſo the word of God, ſhall neuer receiue loſſe, whether it be allowed or diſſalowed of men.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer how can it be, that the authority of the word of God, ſhould depend vpon the allowance or conſent of the Church, ſeeing that the Church it ſelfe borroweth all her authoritie of the word, as it were of her foundation? for it is built vpon the foundation of <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 20.</note> the Apoſtles and Prophets.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
                  <p>But they ſay, that in this place, it is not meant of the truth of the word in it ſelfe, but of the meane whereby it is vnderſtood, and receiued of men. Which they affirme to hang vppon the teſtimony and allowance of the Church. To which purpoſe they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge this ſaying of a certaine Father, I ſhould not
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:20291:7"/> haue beleeued the Goſpell, if the authoritie of the <note place="margin">Aug. contra epiſt. fund. Manich.</note> Church did not moue me</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mat.</speaker>
                  <p>This ſentence maketh not for them. For this was the mind of that holy man, that being a ſtranger from the faith, he was moued by the authoritie of the Church to embrace the Goſpell, and that after by the working of the holy Ghoſt, he was confirmed it that faith. Which hee doth a little before declare in theſe words; The Church firſt calleth vs to beleeue that, which yet we are not able to ſee, that being made ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in faith, we may come to vnderſtand that which we beleeue, not now men, but God himſelfe inwardly ſtrengthening and lightning our mind.</p>
                  <p>Which thing I doubt not but it is true, namely that the witneſſe which the Church giueth to the word of God, doth not a little moue vs to embrace it. But then onely this is, when our faith is beginning: for when it is come to any age, and we our ſelues by reading &amp; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the word, haue taſted of that truth, then we beleeue not by the teſtimony of the Church, but by that which the holie Ghoſt ſealeth in our hearts. In ſo much as if the Church ſhould then teach vs a doctrin diuerſe from that, we would not giue our conſents vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. This ſhall be made plaine by the example of the Samaritanes. Thoſe hearing the report of the woman with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lord had ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he was the Chriſt, beleeued. But after that themſelues had heard him, they ſaid vnto the woman, now wee beleeue not any <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 39. 42.</note> more for thy ſaying, for we haue heard him our ſelues, and do know, that this is indeede the Chriſt, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour of the world.</p>

                  <p>This example bringeth no ſmall light to this doubt. But hitherto ſufficientlie of the truth, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the word of God: now let vs in a few words conſider, what it doth containe.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</note> That in one diuine eſſence, there be three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct perſons, the Father, the Sonne, the holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>The Father indeede is the beginning of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, but yet in reſpect of the order of the perſons. For in the Godhead, we may not ſeeke for any firſt or laſt.</p>
                  <p>The Sonne is the wiſedome of the Father, begotten of himſelfe before the worlds.</p>
                  <p>The holy Ghoſt is the infinit power proceeding fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Father and the Sonne.</p>
                  <p>Now theſe three perſons are diſtinct one from the other, not onely by thoſe incommunicable properties which each of them hath by himſelfe, that none of the other can haue, but alſo by the difference of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. For the Scripture aſcribeth to the Father, the beginning of working, to the Sonne, wiſedome &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and to the holy Ghoſt, vertue and power. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they be alike in all things, in reſpect of eternitie, dignitie and power, becauſe there is one moſt vndiuided diuine eſſence common to them, and ſo they are one God. Howbeit ſo often as at one time there is mention of the Father and the Sonne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or of the holy Ghoſt, the name of God is then peculiarly giuen to the Father, as vnto the firſt perſon of the Deitie, &amp; yet nothing is diminiſhed of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of the Sonne or of the holy Ghoſt: but the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the eſſence is kept, and reſpect is had of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:20291:8"/> of the perſons. Hence it is, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 16.</note> that the Sonne is called the Sonne of God, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 2.</note> and the ſpirit is called the ſpirite of God. But whenſoeuer the name of God is put indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely, the Sonne and the Spirite are no leſſe noted by it, then the Father; as when the Scripture ſaith: <note place="margin">

                  <p>It may be gathered out of diuerſe places, but moſt eaſily it is declared by this of Iohn: there be three <note place="margin">1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 7.</note> which beare witneſſe in heauen, the Father, the Word, and the holy Spirit, and theſe three are one.

                  <p>To the Sonne, that name is attributed by a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude.

                  <p>The diuinity was not changed into the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie: for it remained, eternall, infinit and impaſſible.

And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as alſo after death, created and finite, which at one time could not be in more places, for this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the nature of a true body.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 How Chriſt hath ſatisfied the iudgement of God for our ſinnes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 How he maketh vs partakers of the heauenly life.</p>

                  <speaker>Mat.</speaker>
                  <p>To the end it may the more eaſily bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, we muſt reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber that, whereof we ſpake before; namely that God hath pronounced the curſe againſt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:20291:13"/> all ſuch as tranſgreſſe his Law, and that wee in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects haue broken it: that is to ſay, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">transgression </seg>1</label> by leauing vndone the good which he requireth: <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">transgression </seg>2</label> and by doing the euill which he forbiddeth. Now Chriſt hath prouided a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie for both: for while he was in this earth, hee did fully and perfectly fulfill the Law for vs. Moreouer, he ſuffred the death of the croſſe with extreme reproch, that hee might to the vtmoſt endure the puniſhment due to our ſins. By which meanes, hauing abundantly ſatisfied the perfect iuſtice of God for vs, he maketh a way to his mercy, whereby we may obtain the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of ſins. And in this ſenſe it is ſaid, <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19</note> That we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed by the precious bloud of Chriſt. <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2 24</note> That Chriſt vpon the tree did beare our ſins in his bodie. <note place="margin">1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.</note> That the bloud of Chriſt, doth cleanſe vs from all ſinne.</p>

                  <p>I cannot ſufficiently wonder at the excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great loue of God toward vs, that hee gaue his moſt dearly beloued Son to the death to redeeme vs.</p>

                  <speaker>Mat.</speaker>
                  <p>Adde this, which were his enemies; which alſo is diligently obſerued by the Apoſtle in theſe wordes: Doubtleſſe one wil ſcarſe die for a righteous man: for, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 7.</note> for one that is profitable to him, peraduenture ſome man will die.

                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 10.</note> to God, by the death of his Sonne, much more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reconciled ſhall we be ſaued by his life.</p>

                  <p>But could the iudgement of God bee no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe ſatisfied for our ſinnes, except his beloued Sonne had taken vpon him our nature, therein to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer death, the death (I ſay) of the Croſſe?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mat,</speaker>
                  <p>No; for man which hath offended the infinite Maieſty of God, doth deſerue infinit puniſhment, that is to ſay, eternall death, which could not be ſuffred and ouercome of anie, but of the eternall and infinit Sonne of God. Moreouer, the iuſtice of God required this, that the nature which had ſinned, ſhould ſuffer the puniſhment of ſin. But becauſe God could not ſuffer,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:20291:14"/> and man could not ouercome death, it was neceſſarie that the Redeemer ſhould be verie God, &amp; very man, to do both. Wherein alſo it is to be marked, how neere an atoneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t God hath entred into with vs by Chriſt, in whom the parties at variance be inſeparably ioyned together: whereby it is come to paſſe, that God hath turned the fall of man to his great good: for, thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he hath taken occaſion to vnite vs more nearly with him ſelfe. <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 20.</note> Wherefore where ſinne was increaſed, there grace hath abounded much more by Chriſt.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
                  <p>Hitherto we haue heard ſufficiently of the firſt point, namely, how Chriſt hath ſatisfied the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God for our ſinnes: now let vs come to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which is, by what right wee may claime to our ſelues euerlaſting life.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mat.</speaker>
                  <p>By a double right through Chriſt. Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe for vs he hath fulfilled the whole Law, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Leuit.</hi> 18. 5.</note> and God hath promiſed life to ſuch as fulfill it. Secondly by the right of inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. For after that Chriſt is made ours, we are not onely partakers of his ſpirituall riches, as his perfect righteouſneſſe and obedience, whereby wee are accompted iuſt before God, but alſo of his dignity, namely, that with him we are reckened and taken for the children of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17.</note> Therefore Paule ſaith, If we be ſonnes, wee are alſo heires; heires indeed of God, but heires annexed with Chriſt. And againe in another place, he calleth eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life the inheritance of the Saints, and ſo hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſeth both the rights, by the which wee lay claime to <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1. 12.</note> it for our ſelues.</p>

                  <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
                  <p>Therefore in Chriſt alone we find all things neceſſarie to ſaluation.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mat.</speaker>
                  <p>Yea verily: For in him there is righteouſneſſe, and the fulneſſe of life, and without him, man full of ſinne, findeth nothing but euerlaſting malediction and <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 12.</note> curſe. Therefore Peter ſaith: that neither ſaluation is in any other: and that there is no other name vnder heauen giuen among men, whereby we may be ſaued. For this cauſe alſo, the name of Ieſus Chriſt was giuen
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:20291:14"/> him from heauen, by the which his office is plainly ſet forth, that is to ſay, all that which he hath performed for our ſaluation, and doth ſtill performe.</p>

                  <p>Go to therefore, tell me what the name of Ieſus Chriſt ſignifieth, as alſo of whom it was giuen him.</p>

                  <speaker>Mat.</speaker>
                  <p>The name Ieſus ſignifieth (Sauiour): and an Angell gaue it to the Son of God, becauſe (as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe expounded it) he ſhould ſaue his people fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theyr ſinnes. Concerning the name of Chriſt, it is to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. 21.</note> that in times paſt in the old Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, Chriſt was figured or ſhadowed in the Kings, Prophetes and Prieſts, who when they were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrated, were annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with oyle, which ſignified the giftes of the holy Ghoſt. Now the Redeemer promiſed, in Hebrew was called Meſſias, but in Greeke it is tranſlated by the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 25.</note> word Chriſt, which in Latine ſignifieth annointed. By which name, we are taught that he is the chiefe.</p>

                  <p>Howbeit he was annointed not with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon viſible oyle, but with the grace of the holy Ghoſt, &amp; that moſt fully, that from him as from the head, it might be pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into each member, namely into all the faithfull: in ſo much as they alſo together with him are made Kings, Prophets and Prieſts. Now the name of Chriſt hath bin retained in all tongues, becauſe the Apoſtles them ſelues wrote in Greeke. This therefore is the cauſe, why that name was giuen vnto him, as alſo why all the faithful are called chriſtians: euen becauſe they be partakers of his annointing, &amp; therefore of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, propheſie, and prieſthood.</p>

                     <p>To be iuſtified before God, is to be accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted iuſt, that is to ſay, without blot, &amp; vnreproueable.

                     <p>In the Scriptures, there be two righteouſneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſet forth to vs, which alſo do verie much differ the one from the other. Theſe are.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 The righteouſneſſe of the law, and</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The righteouſneſſe of faith.</p>
                     <p>But the holy Scriptures do teach vs, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be iuſtified by the former, which is of the Law, to the end we might flie to the other, which is of faith.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
                     <p>Declare vnto me, wherein both theſe righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſes do ſtand, as alſo what the difference is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Math.</speaker>
                     <p>The righteouſneſſe of the law, is the perfect keeping of the law. For if we did but fully and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fulfill whatſoeuer that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth, we ſhould by our works be iuſt before God, neither ſhould we need anie other righteouſneſſe. But the Apoſtle in diuerſe places ſheweth, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 20. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 11.</note> that this can not be, for as much as all men be ſinners, and therefore vnrighteous: (which ſhall not be omitted by vs when we ſpeake of workes) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he concludeth, that we are iuſtified by faith.</p>
                     <p>But the righteouſneſſe of faith, is the righteouſneſſe
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:20291:17"/> of Ieſus Chriſt, which by faith is freely imputed vnto vs of God. By theſe things thou mayſt vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, what the difference is betwixt the righteouſneſſe of the law, and the righteouſneſſe of faith.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 The Law requireth it of our ſelues, but faith cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs from our ſelues to ſeeke for it in Chriſt, in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> onely it is, and that indeed perfectly.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Againe the Law requireth vs to obſerue and do all that it commandeth, otherwiſe it threatneth the curſe But faith requireth this one thing, namely that we beleeue, and promiſeth all kind of bleſſings to ſuch as beleeue.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Finally the righteouſneſſe of the Law comming from our ſelues, ſhould ſet vp merit, &amp; put away grace. Contrariwiſe the righteouſneſſe of faith, which is from God, taketh away merit, and ſetteth vp grace.</p>

                     <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
                     <p>Now I vnderſtand, wherin both theſe righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſes conſiſt, and in what things the one diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth from the other: But I thinke it may be gathered of your wordes, that we are not properly iuſtified by faith, but by the merit of Chriſt.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mat.</speaker>
                     <p>Thou gathereſt rightly: For if faith ſhould iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie by any inward vertue, as it is always weake &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, our righteouſneſſe alſo ſhould be imperfect. Faith therefore is as it were an inſtrument wherewith we take hold vpon our perfect righteouſneſſe, which is in Chriſt: which Paul plainly expreſſeth in theſe words; All haue ſinned, and are depriued of the glory of God: <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 23. 24. 25.</note> but are iuſtified freely, that is to ſay, by his grace, by the redemption made in Ieſus Chriſt, whom God hath ſet forth to be a reconciliation through faith in his bloud.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Firſt the Apoſtle witneſſeth, that all men be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous, for as much as all men haue ſinned, and therefore be depriued of the fauour of God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Then he teacheth vs, that the righteouſneſſe, by the which we are iuſtified before God, hath the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in the onely merit of Chriſts death, wherewith God is pacified, ſo as he is become mercifull and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable vnto vs.</p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:20291:17"/>
                     <p n="3">3 To conclude, he ſheweth that freely by faith, we are made partakers of that righteouſneſſe of Chriſt. How often ſoeuer therefore this manner of ſpeach is vſed by the Apoſtle: we are iuſtified by faith; he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth, that this is done by the moſt perfect righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, obedience, and ſatisfaction of Ieſus Chriſt, which gifts are imputed vnto vs, when we are by faith made one with him.</p>

                     <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
                     <p>it followeth then, that all our righteouſneſſe is onely in imputation.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mat.</speaker>
                     <p>Yea truely. For it is neceſſary to the end we may be accounted righteous before God, that our vnrighteouſneſſe be not imputed vnto vs, and that Chriſtes righteouſneſſe be imputed. Now Chriſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth both theſe, the imputation of whoſe giftes, cauſeth that our ſinnes be not layd to our charge, for as much as by the benefite of that imputation they be couered &amp; remoued out of the ſight of God, although he knoweth euery one of them, ſo as he can tell their very number. This caſe therefore ſtandeth as it doth with the blackneſſe of a coale ſet on fire, which black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe we know to be in the coale, although we ſee it not with our eves.</p>

                        <p>The firſt is this, that by afflictions for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe ſake the Lord vouchſafeth vs the honor to be Martyrs, that is to ſay, witneſſes of his truth. And ſo he turneth the puniſhment ioyned with ſhame which we haue deſerued, into moſt glorious ſufferings. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Peter ſpeaking of them, ſaith: that it is better, if ſo the will of God be, that doing well we ſhould be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, then doing euill.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Another is, that by them we are made like, not onely to the holy Patriarchs, Prophets, Apoſtles, &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Martyrs, which liued before our times: but alſo to Chriſt himſelfe, which hath ſet himſelfe before vs as a patterne of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; with whom (ſaith the Apoſtle) <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 12.</note> we ſhall no otherwiſe be glorified, except we ſuffer with him.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 The third is, becauſe the glorie of God, which ought to be farre dearer vnto vs, then our owne life, is thus not a little aduanced: for, it commeth to paſſe, that the very enemies of the Chriſtian truth, are called to the knowledge of Chriſt, and the weake be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in it, by our conſtancie, and open confeſſion of God his name. Therfore it was well ſayd of one of the auncient fathers, <note place="margin">Tertul. in apol. adu. gent.</note> that the bloud of the Martyrs is the ſeede of the Church.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 The fourth is, that while we be made partakers of Chriſtes ſufferings, the ſpirit of God reſteth vpon vs, wherewith we are maruellouſly comforted. <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 14 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 5.</note> For, as the ſufferings of Chriſt abound in vs, euen ſo through

                        <p n="5">5 The fift is, becauſe our reward is great in heauen, euen as Chriſt himſelfe witneſſeth, <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 12.</note> Yea he willeth vs to reioyce and to leape for ioy in the middeſt of afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Paule alſo ſaith the ſame in theſe wordes: <note place="margin">

For the things which are ſeene are temporall, but the things which are not ſeene, are eternall Therefore we haue no occaſion of heauineſſe offered vnto vs by ſuffering in this ſort: yea rather we ought to receiue great matter of comfort and ioy, as of the greateſt good which is wont to be giuen of God, and as of a ſpeciall gift which he giueth not, but to his elect, and moſt dearely beloued children.

Much leſſe is this article to be vnderſtood, of Chriſts ſoule going downe into the place of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For Chriſt ſaid to the theefe, this day ſhalt thou <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Luc.</hi> 23. 43.</note> be with me in Paradiſe.

                              <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19. 39</note> it hath beene before declared by vs, that they which wrote this Creed, looked vnto this, that in each article they might ſet before vs, the ſeuerall remedies, which
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:20291:29"/> be miniſtred vnto vs by Chriſt, againſt all kindes of temptations and ſpirituall diſcaſes. Therefore they would not onely expreſſe the paines which he ſuffered in his body, but alſo the fearefull torments which he ſuffered in his ſoule, and which vnto vs are moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, for theſe we haue deſerued to endure for euer in Hell it ſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the temptations whereof farre excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that which ariſeth of the afflictions of this life, yea and of bodily death. Wherefore hauing compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended all theſe paines generally in this Article; hee ſuffered vnder Pontius Pilate, afterward they would handle them particularly. And firſt of all, thoſe which <note place="margin">The order of the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which reſpect Chriſt.</note> he ſuffered in body, in theſe words, Hee was crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, dead, and buried: for they purpoſely ioyned his buriall, that as it were in one rowe they might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all things, which appertaine to the abaſing of his body. Which being declared, they added thoſe horrible torments, which he ſuffered in his ſoule, in theſe words; Hee deſcended into Hell. Which they did, to the end we may vnderſtand, that Chriſt when hee had ſuffered all the things, which we ſhould haue ſuffered in Hell, did as much, as if by a locall deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, hee had deſcended into Hell it ſelfe; and that therefore we are free from it.</p>

                        <p>It is the hatred of ſinne, and an earneſt loue of righteouſneſſe, by the which we are continually ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp to abhorre our vices, and are mooued to doe good workes, not for feare of puniſhment, or hope of reward, but for that loue wee beare towardes God,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:20291:32"/> which worketh in vs, that with a ioyfull heart wee are moued to his obedience, and with griefe go aſtray from his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements.

                        <p>Two. Namely,</p>
                        <p n="1">1 The mortification or killing of the old man, that is to ſay, of the corruption which by reaſon of ſin ſtic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth within vs.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 And the reſurrection of the new man.</p>
                        <p>The ſame alſo be the partes of regeneration, for it is neceſſarie, that the holy Ghoſt doe firſt kill all euils, and euen corruption it ſelf, before it plant good things in our hearts.

                        <p>Moreouer the riſing againe of the new man, which borroweth his force and efficacy from the reſurrection of Chriſt, worketh ſtrength in vs, by meanes whereof from the heart we apply our ſelues to the obedience of God, which alſo the ſame Apoſtle plainely teacheth, where he ſaith; We are buried together with Chriſt by Baptiſme into his death, <note place="margin">

                        <p>They are indeed, for it is impoſſible that any man ſhould be partaker of Chriſts death, but the ſame alſo is partaker of the fruit of his reſurrection. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle expreſly affirmeth it; If we be grafted with Chriſt <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 5.</note> to the ſimilitude of his death, euen ſo ſhall we be to the ſimilitude of his reſurrection. For this cauſe ſo often as the Scripture ſpeaketh of repentance, it doth not only ſimply vnderſtand, ſome grief conceiued for our ſinnes, but reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of life, and returning to a better courſe, which be witneſſes of that ſorow lying hid in the heart.</p>
                        <p>Therefore ſuch as bragge of repentance, and yet do not returne, nor giue them ſelues to amendement of life, are lyers, and do mocke God himſelfe.</p>

For ſeeing thoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and powers are giuen vnto vs by the ſpirit of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, it is without doubt that we lacke them and therfore that we are altogether vnable of our ſelues to beleeue, or to do well.</p>

                              <hi>Iohn.</hi> 15. 4.</note> can beare no fruit of it ſelfe, except it abide in the vine: euen ſo neither can you, except you abide in me. He that abideth in me, &amp; in whom I abide, the ſame brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth much good fruit, for without me you can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Which things being ſo, what can man of himſelf beleeue in the matter of Religion, but errour and lyes? what is he able to do when the queſtion is of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping God, but all manner vice and wikedneſſe? I will ad a place out of Paule, wherein all this doctrine in one word is plainly ſet down. You were dead in ſinnes and <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 1.</note> treſpaſſes. He ſaith not you were ſicke, ſo as ſome little life was left in you, but you were altogether dead. The ſelf ſame thing alſo he confirmeth afterward, when he ſaith: <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 6.</note> that we are raiſed vp from the dead, when God doth regenerate vs. If therfore the vnregenerate man be ſpiritually dead in ſinnes, it followeth that he hath no more vnderſtanding in things pertaining to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſaluation, then hath a dead man in the things of this life.</p>
                        <p>Moreouer if a man vnregenerate be ſpiritually dead in ſinnes, he hath no more power to do a good deede, then a dead man hath to do the actions of the body.</p>
                        <p>Therefore euen as our ſoule giueth life to the body, ſo alſo the ſpirite of God is the life of our ſoule, being otherwiſe dead, and vnable to beleeue or do any thing that is good.</p>

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:20291:34"/> that God ſeemeth to mock vs, which ſo often by the Prophets exhorteth vs to turne vnto him, and to keepe his commandements, if it were not in our power, at leaſt in ſome part to do this.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, that exhortations be made in vaine, the vſe of admonitions is but needleſſe, and that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofes are but ridiculous, if it were not in the power of the ſinner not to ſinne.</p>

Vpon this rocke therefore ſaith he, which thou haſt confeſſed, will I build my church. For the rock was Chriſt, vpon the which foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation Peter himſelfe was builded.

But he proueth this out of the teſtimonie of Eſay: Behold, I put in Sion a chiefe corner ſtone, elect &amp; precious, in whom whoſoeuer beleeueth ſhall not be aſhamed. Hee addeth alſo out of the Pſalme: The ſtone which the builders refuſed, is made the head of the corner, that is to ſay, vpholdeth all the building.</p>

                        <p n="1">1 Firſt, becauſe the old church, did ſet forth Chriſt his death and reſurrection darkely, by certaine out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ceremonies, as ſacrifices, lights, waſhings, and ſuch other, <note place="margin">

                        <p>Wherefore ſeeing that by his comming hee hath put an end vnto thoſe ceremonies, he hath now laide himſelfe open vnto vs farre more plainly. For he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth forth, as it were in the mid-day, abounding with his gifts, that euerie one may ſee and know them. For this cauſe the Apoſtle compareth the fathers which liued vnder the Law, vnto children, which did learne as it were their letters and firſt grounds, to giue vs to vnderſtand, that wee may be called learned and skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full if we be compared with them.

But after his reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, when hee had put an end to the ceremonies of the law, hee biddeth his Apoſtles, going into all the <note place="margin">

                        <p>Although particular Churches, be ſeen of vs, yet becauſe here is intreated of the vniuerſall church, which we cannot behold with the eyes of the bodie: therefore wee doe not ſaie, I ſee, but I beleeue the Church. I adde moreouer that the Church properly is no other but that companie of the elect. For the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites and reprobats which are mingled with the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches, are not members of the vniuerſall Church. I do annex furthermore for a larger decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of theſe two arguments. Firſt,</p>
                        <p n="1">1 That it falleth out not ſeldome, that by the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions of the enemies, the Church is ſo ſcattered, that it ſeemeth almoſt to be cleane put out: Howbeit
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:20291:39"/> it is not ſo, but onely for a time it is remoued from our fight euen as the wheat lieth hidden vnder the chaffe. Which indeed came to paſſe in the dayes of Elias: for <note place="margin">1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 19. 10.</note> the Prophet complained that he aloue was left. For he thought that all the people were fallen away from true Religion. Notwithſtanding the Lord anſwered: There be remaining vnto me ſeuen thouſand, which haue not bowed their knee before Baal. Therefore when the Church is hidden either in the whole or in the partes, yet ought we not thereupon to ceaſſe to beleeue that it is: For the Lord ſaid by the Prophet, that Iſraels ſeed <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 36.</note> ſhould not faile, as long as Sunne and Moone ſhould bee in the heauens The ſame thing doth Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, <note place="margin">

                        <p>It is a ſimilitude or likeneſſe taken from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealths, in the which in former times iudgement was vſed at the gates of their Citties, where alſo the ſtore of Armour &amp; munition for warre was kept.

                        <p>It is drawne from this that although in it there haue alwayes bin manie elect (ſeeing the word of God is neuer preached in vaine,) yet neuer the leſſe all they that ioyne them ſelues to particular churches, do not
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:20291:40"/> ſtraight way belong to the vniuerſall church: that is to ſay, are not by and by of the number of the faithfull and choſen. For as (ſaith Auſten) <note place="margin">

And this is the cauſe, why ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.</note> mention of the inuiſible Church, I comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded vnder it the elect of God ſtill liuing in the earth.</p>

                        <p>No not ſo: For, each of them may know their owne faith, by the feeling put into them by the holie Ghoſt, and anothers faith they cannot. The word of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing containeth all theſe things. For it is as if thou ſaydeſt, I beleeue that there is a certaine companie of the faithfull and elect in the Church, which God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth in this world, of whoſe number I certainely know that I am. In the meane time Chriſtian charitie requireth this, that we iudge well of all thoſe, that haue ioyned the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to particular churches, ſo long as they ſhew themſelues tractable, and do obey admonitions.</p>

                        <p>Not only for this cauſe, but eſpecially becauſe it is gathered together by the diuine working of it, by the which indeede we are knit together into one bodie with Chriſt, and are partakers of all his giftes, that is to ſay, the merit of his death is communicated vnto vs, by the which wee obtaine forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, the force alſo of his reſurrection is imparted, by the which we ſhall riſe againe in that laſt day, &amp; ſhal liue eternally with him. All which things, are in the Creed in exact order declared preſently after the article of the church</p>

                        <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
                        <p>Hitherto we haue ſpoken ſufficiently of the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:20291:40"/> true Church, therefore we haue diſpatched the firſt point that I propounded. <note place="margin">Of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints.</note> Let vs therfore come to the other. What is the cauſe that thou ſaydeſt, we were no leſſe ioyned by the holy Ghoſt with the Church, then with Chriſt?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Mat.</speaker>
                        <p>Becauſe it cannot ioyn the faithful with Chriſt, but it doth alſo ioyne them together among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, euen as the members cannot be ioyned with the head, but they be alſo vnited together into the bodie. Now this is a moſt fit ſimilitude, and beſt agreeth to the vnio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which we haue with Chriſt. For as the head, if it be ioyned with the members, guideth them, nouriſheth them, and giueth them life and motion, euen ſo Chriſt perfourmeth all theſe things to his Church, with the which he is made one by the working of the holy ghoſt. For this cauſe is this ſentence ſo often repeated of the Apoſtle; <note place="margin">

                     <p n="2">2 The ſecond is of man, who being by his owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a moſt wretched ſinner, is guiltie of eternall death before the iudgement ſeate of God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The third is of Chriſt Ieſus, whoſe death is a moſt preſent remedie for vs againſt death.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 The fourth is of faith, wherby that remedy is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to vs for our ſaluation.</p>

Moreouer, ſeeing in the firſt Chapter of the former booke, it hath bene declared, what manner one God is, and in the third and fourth Chapters, what a one he ſheweth himſelfe towards vs; this one thing ſeemeth now to remaine, that we vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, how we ſhould carrie our ſelues toward him, that is to ſay, what works are to be done of vs, that we may obey him, and be acceptable to his Maieſtie.</p>

                     <p>But in the former booke, when we ſpake of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, we did ſufficiently diſcuſſe that ſecond point.

                              <p>They bee three. The firſt whereof is this, that when God commandeth good, hee doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie forbid the euill that is contrarie vnto it, which indeed is done in the lawes of men. But when he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth euill, he commandeth the good that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie vnto it, and this is peculiar or proper to the law of God. For example. When God forbiddeth to take his name in vaine, he doth on the contrarie ſide com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that it be hallowed and honored of vs. When he forbiddeth, that no man ſteale, he commandeth vs to giue our ſelues vnto charitie.

                              <p>Why bee almoſt all the commandements deliuered rather negatiuely then affirmatiuely, that is to ſay, ſo as they rather forbid euill, then command that which is good?</p>

                              <p>Indeede that is well marked of thee; for, only two, namely the laſt of the firſt table, wherein the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of the Sabaoth day, and the firſt of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table, wherein the honour of parents bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, be propounded affirmatiuely, all the reſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiuely, and ſo forbid euils. But this was done that we might vnderſtand, that no man can giue his minde to that which is good, before he haue laide aſide the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:20291:46"/> euill that fighteth with it. Euen as we ſee that thorns muſt be firſt pulled vp, before good ſeede bee ſowen. Therefore the Prophet calling the Iſraelites to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſaith; <note place="margin">

As for example. When God would forbid murthers, reuenges, iniuries, and priuy hatreds, he comprehended them all vnder the word <hi>murther,</hi> to teach vs, that he which hateth his brother, is a murtherer, as Iohn ſaith. The ſame is to be ſaid <note place="margin">1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 15.</note> of him, which looketh vpon a woman to luſt after her: for Chriſt affirmeth, that ſuch a one hath committed <note place="margin">

                              <p>They be indeed the bookes of the vnlearned: For, they can teach nothing but vanitie and lying, as the Scripture teſtifieth: and therefore they hold men in ignorance, and make them idiots and vnlearned, which experience it ſelfe proueth.

                              <p>It is according to our ſecond rule, namely, that God when he meaneth to forbid many ſinnes of the ſame kind, forbiddeth them all vnder the name of one, and that the greateſt, ſuch a one as idolatrie is.</p>

                              <p>The reaſon in my iudgement is moſt plaine. For, although a man be mad already, when he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaketh God, for ſome excellent gifts wherewith any creature hath beene adorned of God, and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth that creature: yet then he may be ſayd to be ſtriken through with rage and furie, when he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippeth an ſdoll, made by the induſtrie and helpe of man. Therfore, the Scripture deſcribing that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, calleth Idols the works of mens hands, and preſently after addeth: They haue a mouth and ſpeake <note place="margin">
                                    <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115. 4.</note> not; they haue eyes and ſee not; they haue eares and heare not; they haue noſes and ſmell not; they haue hands and handle not; they haue feete and walke not; and finally that they be dead. In which words he ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, that men be altogether out of their wits, which worſhip the worke of mans hands, an Image, dumbe, blind, deafe, that perceiueth nothing, and is voyde of all the ſences, and therefore inferior to his maker and worſhipper: which appeareth euen by this, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them would be like their Idoll.</p>

For they ſay, they be not ſo voyde of reaſon, but they know, they be either of wood, or ſtones, or of painting. But rather they affirme boldly and conſtantly, that all the worſhip is done by them, in the honour of God or of the Saints, whereof they be Images.</p>

                              <p>What although we ſhould graunt them all that they ſay? were not this extreme madneſſe, that
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:20291:52"/> they will worſhip God, by doing the thinges, that bee directly forbidden of him? Which alſo hee affirmeth to be deſpight againſt him. But howſoeuer they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie it, it is ſo. For, when they preferre one Idoll be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore another, and for religions ſake take vppon them long pilgrimages, to ſalute ſuch an Image, do mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble their praiers before them, euen as for that purpoſe they haue manie Images with them: it is clearer then the light, that they thinke there is in them ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine power. And therefore they bee conuinced, that thoſe Images be taken of them for Gods. Whereupon the Idolaters of that time are moſt ſharpely reproued by Eſay, although they euen then ſought the ſame <note place="margin">
                                    <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44. 7.</note> ſhifts. So is the Deuill wont to bewitch all thoſe, that receiue Idols for religions ſake; for at the beginning indeede, he perſwadeth them, that they bee receiued that God may bee worſhipped in them; but by little and little, he blindeth them with their mad religion, ſo as at the length they both worſhip them, and put their truſt in them. And indeede (as Auſten ſaid moſt truely) no man looking vpon Images, can doe them any worſhip, whoſe minde is not ſo moued, as if he were heard of them.</p>
                              <p>For this cauſe, the Fathers of the Elibertine coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, the yeare from the birth of Chriſt 330, decreed thus concerning this matter; <note place="margin">

                              <p n="1">1 Firſt, they be fowlly deceiued in this, that they thinke thoſe old Idolaters beleeued their Idols to bee gods: for they cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> according to their pleaſure, but they alwayes kept the ſame Gods in their mind.</p>
                              <p n="2">2 Moreouer, there was no God of theirs, which had not many Images: and yet they did not according to that multitude, make to themſelues many gods.</p>

It is indeede certaine, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ſometimes reprooued the Iſraelites for this, that they ſaide to theyr Idols: Thou art my God. But this was done for the cauſe which I ſpake of before, for that giuing to Images the honour due vnto God alone, they eſteemed them in the place of God, notwithſtanding, they coloured that Idolatrie with faire excuſes.</p>

                              <p>That indeede is true, but they did neuer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme them alike; but rather conſtantly continued in this minde, that there was one chiefe God, to whom all the reſt were ſubiect. For, ſo is the feeling of one God-head grauen in the mindes of men, that it can not bee pluckt out, notwithſtanding it be corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by their own mad inuentions, and that more is, by their Idolatrie, as Paule ſaith vnto the Romaines.<note place="margin">

                              <p>There is. But that we may rightly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, we muſt know, that there be two kinds of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences. The one is called an offence taken, which fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vpon the head of the taker, foraſmuch as none occaſion was giuen.

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:20291:59"/> of God, or refuſeth to do ſome euill thing, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of God. For, euen as our libertie muſt be ſubiect vnto charitie, ſo charitie ought to be ſubiect to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of faith and righteouſneſſe of the law. Therefore thou mayeſt not offend God, to auoyd the offence of thy neighbour. The other kind of offence, is called of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence giuen, the fault and condemnation whereof, lighteth vpon him of whom it is giuen: as when one giueth offence to his neighbour, by doing ſomething forbidden of God, or elſe offendeth the vnskilfull and weake, by vſing indifferent things ill.</p>

But this viſitation is fulfilled, when the Lord taketh from the houſe of the vngodly his grace, the light of his trueth, and the other helpes of ſaluation. Now then, nothing elſe can bee looked for, but that the children being forſaken of God, ſhould liue moſt wickedly, and moue God to take vengeance vpon them.

                              <p>This example maketh more againſt them, then for them. For that Naaman the Sirian, the chiefe Captaine of the hoaſt of the king of Aram, and moſt deare to the King himſelfe, when he was firſt conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the religion of the true God, knew that he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, if hee did but onely apply himſelfe in his ſeruice, and bowing to the King while he worſhipped, and hee prayeth God to forgiue him that ſinne. But theſe our
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:20291:61"/> Nicodemits, which haue ſo many yeares bene taught the knowledge of God and of his ſpirituall worſhip, and indeede farre more clearly, then the Fathers vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law euer were, cannot be brought thus farre: to confeſſe that they ſinne, when euerie where of their own voluntarie accord, and without anie inforcement of the kings authoritie, that vſeth their ſeruice, they be partakers of Idolatrie and ſuperſtitions. Verily the confeſſion of Naaman the Syrian ſhall be ſufficient to condemne them in the day of iudgement: ſo farre off therefore is it, that by it they can by anie meanes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelues. Concerning the anſwer of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; Go in peace, he doth not by it allow the ſinne of Naaman. Neither was it his mind to flatter Naaman, but when hee ſaw him in ſo little ſpace of time to haue profited ſo well in the knowledge and feare of God, ſo as freely he confeſſed and condemned his owne infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, he incouraged him, and putteth him in hope, that God would ſtrengthen him, and bring that to perfection, which he had begun in him.</p>
                              <p>For this cauſe he ſaith; Go in peace. But if he had had to do with the Nicodemits of our age, hee would haue vſed farre other manner of ſpeach, &amp; would haue alowd cried out the ſame thing, which Elias that went before him did to the Iewes of his time, mingling the worſhip of Idols with the ſeruice of God; How long <note place="margin">1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 18. 22.</note> do you halt betweene two opinions? if the Lord bee God, follow him: but if Baal be he, go after him.</p>

                              <p n="1">1 The firſt is: that the thing whereupon we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to ſweare, be not only true, but alſo that the truth of it be certainly knowne to vs.</p>

                                 <note place="margin">Why the Lord vnder the Law, commanded the ſabaoth.</note> That we may vnderſtand that point, we muſt know, that the Sabbaoth was commanded of God for two cauſes, the firſt whereof was ceremoniall. That ceremonie alſo is conſidered in two reſpects. For, by that bodily reſt, the Lord meant to warne the people of Iſraell, to abſtaine and reſt from their owne workes being carnall and defiled, that they might ſuffer the holy Ghoſt to worke in them. This doth he himſelfe witneſſe in theſe wordes; See that you keepe my Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoth, becauſe it is a ſigne betweene mee and you in your generations, that you may know, that it is I the Lord, which ſanctifie you. Out of which wordes it is plaine, that that ceremonie, was a type or ſhadowe of our regeneration.</p>
                              <p>Secondly, that ceremony ſerued, to ſignifie the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting reſt of the kingdome of heauen, which was as it were a part of the former. For that cauſe the Lord calleth the land of Canaan, reſt, becauſe it

                              <p>The other end of the bodily reſt, is this, that we may wayte vpon the miniſterie of the Church: for that is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed by God in this commandement.

Theſe are the two endes of this bodily reſt, the firſt whereof together with the reſt of the ceremonies, is taken away by the comming of Chriſt, which is the trueth of it.

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:20291:70"/> of that reſt. Hee doth alſo call to our remembrances the creation of the world, that we might remember of whom wee haue our beginning, and the innumerable benefites that we enioy. The Sabbaoth day therefore ſhould be vnto vs as it were an image of the creation of the world: and vppon that day ought we to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate and thinke vppon that creation, leaſt we bee guilty of that fault, which God in former times by Moyſes vpbraided the Iewes with; Thou haſt forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that ſtrong God which hath begotten thee, the God which made thee thou haſt not remembred.</p>
                              <p>Hereuppon it is, that by name he reckeneth vp eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his workes by it ſelfe, for in ſixe dayes the Lord made the heauen and the earth, the ſea and all that is in them.

But this hee would teach vs, that hee hath ceaſed from making of the kindes of thinges. Finally the bleſſing and hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Sabbaoth day is after added, not becauſe that day is in it ſelfe holier then others, but for that it is of God, appointed for this purpoſe, that wee ſhould reſt from our owne workes, and diligently giue our ſelues to holy workes.</p>

But for the vpholding of that pollicie, it is neceſſarie that ſome be ſuperiors, and other ſome inferiors, and that the ſuperiors be armed with ſome authority, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they may keepe the ſubiects within the bounds of their dutie, and prouide that the mightier do no wrong to men of meane qualitie. Nowe all theſe things doth the Lord ordaine in the fift commandement. For by li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and litle he doth in continuance of time bring vs to all lawful ſubiection, beginning with that which is moſt eaſie to be borne. Hauing ſetled and appointed Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, he doth preſently ioyne laws, by the which they ought to gouerne their ſubiectes peaceably, and keepe them in equitie and iuſtice: From whence alſo euerie one ſhould ſeeke the rule of loue, that they may liue with their neighbours according to the will of God.</p>

When he hath taken order for the ſafegard of mens liues, becauſe men are mortall, in the ſeuenth commandement, forbidding whoredome, he enioineth
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:20291:71"/> mariage to all men that haue not the gift of continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, to the end mankind may be preſerued and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And becauſe a familie or houſhold followeth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, to the ſuſtaining whereof riches are required, in the eight commandement he appointeth to euerie one proprietie of goods, while he forbiddeth theft where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with quiet poſſeſſion is diſturbed and troubled. And doth alſo command, that we labour to get riches, both for our owne vſe, and by vs to be giuen to the poore. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward becauſe it cannot be (ſuch is the deſire &amp; co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſneſſe of men) that goods can be enioyed of vs, but that oftentimes there ariſe ſtrifes &amp; controuerſies, which the Magiſtrates cannot appeaſe, except they do plainly know the truth of the matter, in the ninth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement the Lord forbiddeth falſe witneſſe bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, which is no ſmall hinderance to the ending of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                              <p>It ſtandeth vpon three parts, Firſt:</p>
                              <p n="1">1 Vpon outward ſaluation proceeding from the inward reuerence which we ought to yeeld vnto them; which ſhall be done, if we acknowledge them to be the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:20291:72"/> miniſters of God for our good.</p>
                              <p n="2">2 The ſecond is, the obedience that wee performe to their commandements, ſo as they be not contrarie to the will of God: for then by the rule of Peter, <note place="margin">
                                    <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 29.</note> wee ought to obey God rather then men.</p>
                              <p n="3">3 The third is, that when they be poore, wee do helpe them with our goods. It is in the meane time to be obſerued, that God doth not onely preſcribe a rule to inferiors, whereby they may giue due honor to their ſuperiours, but doth alſo teach ſuperiours their dutie which they ought to do to their inferiours.</p>

                              <p>No not ſo: for our ſinnes are not excuſed by the ſinnes of others. Moreouer the obedience we giue them is directly referred vnto God, of whom it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and not properly to them ſelues.</p>

                              <p>We haue ſtayed long enough vpon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of this commandement, let vs therfore come to the other: It is the promiſe, the wordes whereof be theſe; That thou mayeſt liue long in the land which the Lord thy God giueth thee. To the expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there be fiue things, whereof I will aske thee.</p>
                              <p n="1">1 Firſt, why the Lord ioyned a promiſe to this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, rather then to the reſt of the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of this later table?</p>

                              <p n="5">5 How this promiſe is fulfilled, foraſmuch as it is certaine, that ſometimes obedient children be taken away by vntimely death, and the ſtubburne and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient liue long?

                              <p>The promiſe is very fitly applied to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement it ſelfe: for, it teacheth modeſt and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent children, while they honor the inſtruments of this life graunted to them, namely their parents, that they ſhall long enioy it.

                              <p>I grant indeed that this corporall life, if it be ſeparated from the fauour of God, is moſt miſerable &amp; vnhappie: but it is a bleſſing to the faithfull. For, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in it, we ſerue to his glorie, and ſometimes he granteth vs this, that with great peace and quietneſſe, we enioy ſundrie temporall benefites.

                              <p>The laſt point is behind. How this promiſe is fulfilled, ſeeing it is certaine that in many places o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient and ſober children dye being young, and the diſobedient liue long?</p>
                           </sp>

                              <p>It is taught by the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples of Abſolom, Core,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:20291:73"/> Dathan, Abiron, &amp; of the ſonnes of Helie. Experience alſo confirmeth the thing, of ſtubburne &amp; diſobedient children; for they be for the moſt part ſeene, either in priſons or vpon the gallowes. Contrariwiſe the well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed and obedient, for the moſt part haue long life, with great quietneſſe and peace. But if at any time it fall out to be otherwiſe, we muſt remember that all the promiſes of God concerning earthly things be with condition, namely, ſo farre forth as he ſhall know them to be expedient, both for his owne glorie, and for our ſaluation. When therefore God doth betimes call his out of this life vnto himſelfe, he prouideth farre better for them, then if he gaue them long life. For he taketh them from the miſeries of this world, and putteth them into the poſſeſſion of eternall life. On the other ſide, ſometimes he giueth the wicked long life, but ſo weake and full of miſerie, that it is more grieuous then death it ſelfe. For this cauſe Moſes repeating the law of God, <note place="margin">
                                    <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 2.</note> declareth that promiſe in theſe wordes: That it may be well with thee vpon the land which, &amp;c. But, if it fall out otherwiſe, it was for the cauſe which was at large ſet forth by vs, when we intreated of afflictions For, in that place we taught wherefore the Lord will haue the wicked ſomtimes to liue long &amp; happily in this world, and the godly to ſuffer all kind of afflictions. Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, that ſaying of Salomon abideth true: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <note place="margin">

                              <p>It is indeed certaine, that our enemies ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times waxe the prouder, and more inſolent, becauſe of our meekeneſſe: but this is nothing to the matter. For we ought to be ready rather to beare diuers iniuries, then to reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge that which we haue receiued, and that by the commandement of Chriſt; <note place="margin">
                                    <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 39.</note> Reſiſt not euill: but who ſo ſhall ſtrike thee on thy right cheeke, turne to him the other alſo. And this is the true ſence of that place. For the Lord would not haue vs, when we haue receiued one iniurie, to pull another vpon our ſelues, as the words at the firſt ſight ſeeme to require. For it were a ſinne, not to take heed of an iniurie fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene, eſpecially, when oportunitie is offered vs. For, Chriſt himſelfe, and after him Paule, when they were ſtriken vpon the one cheeke, did not turne the other: but did greatly find fault and complaine of the iniury done vnto them. But concerning that prouerbe, that the wolues be fierce vpon ſuch as follow ſheepe, it is a verie deuiſe of the deuill, and therefore moſt falſe: For, whoſoeuer in that behalfe doth imitate ſheepe, is ſafe from the aſſaults of all wolues, being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by the crooke or ſtaffe of that chiefe ſhepheard of our ſoules.

                              <p>The whole matter muſt be committed to God, which one day will take vengeance, both vpon him that hath done vs the wrong, and alſo vpon the Magiſtrate, which in this behalfe hath failed in his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And indeede this is the beſt way: for, if we our ſelues will reuenge when we be able, we ſhall do farre more hurt to our ſelues, then to our aduerſarie. For, we ſhall hurt but the goods or the bodie of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: but we ſo hurt our conſcience, that we bring our owne ſoule into extreame hazard of vtter peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing.

Therefore the beſt is to beare iniuries pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riently, for by that meanes we doe not onely turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from our ſelues many inconueniences, and innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable troubles and dangers, but alſo the Lord, to whom our moderation and obedience is ſeene, giueth vs his fauour and all kind of bleſſings.

                              <p>Firſt of all, couetouſneſſe, that is, deſire of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which the Apoſtle affirmeth to be the roote of all <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.</note> euils, becauſe there is no wickedneſſe, be it neuer ſo hainous, whereunto men are not driuen and brought by that wicked deſire.</p>

                              <p>Now wee are to come to the other part of this commandement: What is contained in it?</p>

                              <p>Firſt, that to our power we preſerue the goods of our neighbor, which in the Scripture is called iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where in many places it admoniſheth vs to doe iuſtice and iudgement. For by the name of iuſtice hee vnderſtandeth this, that wee giue vnto euerie one his right: and by iudgement, that we giue no conſent to any iniurie done to our neighbour, but that wee put it away ſo farre forth as in vs lieth.</p>
                              <p>Secondly, we be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to deale with our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours according to charitie, ſeeing God hath giuen vs goods, to be ſtewards of them, to vſe them ourſelues, ſo farre foorth as neceſſity requireth, and to helpe the poore and needie.

For, whatſoeuer goods we haue be the Lords, and he hath giuen them vnto vs vpon this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition, that we ſhould pay a year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rent, the gatherers and receiuers whereof hee hath appointed the poore. Whoſoeuer therefore refuſeth or draweth backe to helpe the poore, are guilty before God not only of theft, but alſo of ſacriledge, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be altogether worthie, whom hee may depriue of all good things: ſeeing they do not according to their dutie acknowledge him, from whom they haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all.</p>

                              <p>A verie great number indeed. For a man ſhall find verie few, which in this behalfe do their duty. But this ariſeth vppon a falſe opinion, wherewith rich men deceiue them ſelues: namely, becauſe they imagine
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:20291:80"/> that all the goods they haue, whether they came by inheritance, or were otherwiſe gotten, bee ſo their owne, that they be wholly and altogether left to their owne will. And therefore that they bee not bound to helpe ſuch as neede, if they liſt not. Moreouer, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe is ioyned to this vain imagination, which ſo ſhutteth vp in them the bowels of mercy, that they become vtterly vnmercifull. And that for the moſt part falleth out with them, that are moſt wealthie. For, euen as couetouſneſſe moſt commonly ſpringeth from plentie and abundance, ſo is it farre more fitly nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſtrengthened by it, then by pouertie.</p>

This indeed is true, that the moſt part of men do abuſe it, whereuppon do ariſe the innumerable confuſions, which euerie man ſeeth in the world.

                              <p>They be of three kinds. In the firſt place they are to be put, which ſay; Whatſoeuer is mine, is mine, but whatſoeuer is thine, is mine. That is, mine owne is not ſufficient for me, but I do alſo gape for thine. And in this nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber are they all to be reckned, that by any ill meanes get the goods of other men to themſelues.</p>
                              <p>In the ſecond place we will ſet them that ſay; That
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:20291:81"/> that is mine, is mine, but that which is thine, is thine. That is, I will not conueigh thy goods to my ſelfe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo will I giue thee anie part of mine. And this kinde of men refraine indeede from taking away, that which is anothers, but they cannot abide to pleaſure or freely to do good vnto anie.</p>
                              <p>In the laſt ranke we will place them, which ſay; That that is mine is thine, and that which is thine is mine. That is, I am readie to giue thee part of that I haue, but with this conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that thou alſo wilt pleaſure me with that which thou haſt.</p>
                              <p>The firſt of all theſe therefore be further off fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie then the ſecond, and the ſecond further then the laſt, who it is manifeſt come ſomewhat toward it.</p>

                              <p>In that they giue no part of their goods, but to thoſe, of whom they looke to receiue the like, and therefore obey not Chriſt giuing them good counſell; When thou makeſt a dinner or a ſupper, call not thy <note place="margin">
                                    <hi>Luc.</hi> 14. 12.</note> friends, neither thy brethren, nor thy kinsfolkes, nor thy rich neighbours: leſt they alſo bid thee againe, and thou be recompenced. But when thou makeſt a feaſt, call the poore, the maimed, the lame and the blind: &amp; thou ſhalt be bleſſed, becauſe they cannot recompence thee, for thou ſhalt be recompenced at the reſurrection of the iuſt. And yet Chriſt doth not altogether forbid rich men to feaſt among them ſelues, or to pleaſure one another, ſo as they haue regard of the poore as it is meete.</p>

                              <p>It is lawfull: ſo as at the firſt we ſhew that that is our meaning. For it is vnlawfull to demand that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine which was giuen. Therefore altogether with that caution we muſt require our goods againe, which we may keepe for the poore, that by their owne labour are not able to helpe their neceſſitie. For they that be able by labour to ſuſtaine their life, and in the meane time become poore by idleneſſe and ſlouth, be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnworthy to be releeued.

                              <p>So much as their neceſſitie requireth. For Iohn Baptiſt goeth ſo farre, that he teacheth; He that <note place="margin">
                                    <hi>Luc.</hi> 3. 11.</note> hath two coates, let him giue to him that hath none. In the which ſenſe, that communitie of good whereof thou ſpakeſt before is to be taken. Namely, that none <note place="margin">

For they ſold fields and houſes, that they might helpe the poore. This is the true meaning of that place, but we muſt not imagine any confuſion of goods, as if the faithfull had liued in common. For although I ſhould not ſay, that they could not then do it, the words of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Ananias be againſt it; If ſo be thou hadſt kept it, <note place="margin">
                                    <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 4.</note> did not thy field remaine to thy ſelfe? and after it was ſold, was it not in thine owne power?</p>

Howbeit the cauſe that is wont to ſtay vs from liberalitie (namely the feare of pouertie, and deſire to increaſe our wealth) ought eſpecially to kindle vs vp vnto it, if we beleeued the promiſes of God, by the which we are admoniſhed, that they ſhall neuer come to pouertie, that haue releeued the neceſſitie of the <note place="margin">

The other, that is out of iudgement, concerning the things, that we haue to doe with, in dealing with men. Touching falſe witneſſe in iudgement, becauſe an oath commeth between, and the matter concerneth either the life or goods of our neighbour, that wickedneſſe cannot be committed, but three abhominations come forth at one time together; namely falſe witneſſe, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie, theft, or murther.

                              <p>There be diuerſe kinds of them, but we will bring them to three. And they be theſe;</p>

                              <p>When a man diſprayſeth, or mocketh his neighbour being abſent, and ſo empaireth his name &amp; credit. Which is a moſt grieuous offence, for a ſlande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer hurteth three at once.</p>
                              <p n="1">1 Himſelfe.</p>
                              <p n="2">2 The heate: rfor he is guilty of receiuing the ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which God hath expreſly forbidden.</p>
                              <p n="3">3 Him that is mocked or ſlandered. Howbeit the ſlander leaſt of all hurteth him, for his name onely is hurt; but the conſcience of both the former is hurt, by a ſinne committed againſt God and their neighbour.</p>
                              <p>In this rancke are to be placed, whiſperers, or ſecret cary-tales, who indeede do much aggrauate the ſinne they haue committed in receiuing the ſlander, when as whiſpering or muttering it, they giue occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cuils, and eſpecially, if it be amplified and enlarged of them, which moſt commonly falleth out. For this cauſe Salomon ſaith; <note place="margin">

Vnder this kind be all thoſe things conteined, that miniſter occaſion of euill ſpeech: namely an euill or falſe ſuſpition of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, without an euident cauſe giuen; for it is againſt Chriſtian charitie, which Paule ſaith is not ſuſpitious.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5.</note>

                              <p>What if he that diſprayſeth or reporteth ill of his neighbour, ſpeake the truth, may that be called backbiting or ſlandering?</p>

                              <p>It ought: for he ſinneth in a double reſpect. Firſt his mind is eſtranged fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> charitie, yea rather he is moued to that wickedneſſe, by a deſire of ſpeaking euill; or elſe, that he may get him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe prayſe, by the diſprayſe of another. Which thing indeed appeareth euen by this, that ſuch backbiters paſſe ouer all the vertues of their neighbour, but their faults they recken vp, and not ſeldome enlarge them.</p>
                              <p>Secondly, he obiecteth thoſe things againſt his neighbour, not with a mind to amend them, neither
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:20291:83"/> doth he make report of them vnto ſuch to whom it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth to admoniſh them, but he muttereth and whiſpereth it to him, that cannot apply any remedy to the fault: yea rather he hath an ill opinion of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, which doth not a litle hinder Chriſtian charitie.</p>

                              <p>This vice is not ſo hainous as the former, for it is not ſo farre off from Chriſtian charitie. Moreouer the flatterer hurteth onely two, namely himſelfe, and him whom he flattereth. But the backbiter as was ſayd, hurteth three at once. Howbeit, this ſinne is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the Lord: for the flatterer foſtereth the ſinnes of him whom he flattereth ſo ſmoothly, and doubteth not to colour or paint them ouer with the name of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.

Others be of infirmitie and feare, ſuch as was the lye of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſaying that Sarah was his ſiſter. <note place="margin">

                              <p>There be ſome other lyes vnder a colour of loue, &amp; are called officious lyes, when a man by them thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to do his neighbour good.

                              <p>Is is not onely lawfull, but alſo many times expedient, in reſpect both of the common and priuate profite of our neighbours. Yet with this condition, that we be not bound by oath before the Magiſtrate to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it. For otherwiſe, it ſhould not be lawfull for vs to conceale the truth: except the queſtion were of the peace of the Church, or the ſafety of our brethren. For Chriſtian charitie requireth, that we ſhould ſuffer any thing, rather then bring danger to any brother, much more to the whole Church.</p>
                              <p>As for example, if a man were held priſoner of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, he ought rather to ſuffer all kinds of torments, then to declare any thing, that might be to the hurt of his countrey, or of his neighbour.</p>

                              <p>The concluſion is, that thou thinkeſt it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, yea ſometime expedient, to conceale the truth, but that it is not lawfull to lye vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any occaſion, no not for our owne ſafetie, or the ſafetie of our neighbour.</p>

                              <p>The often vſe of it, cauſeth that we thinke it light, but the Scripture iudgeth farre otherwiſe; for it ſaith: <note place="margin">
                                    <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5. 6.</note> O Lord, thou ſhalt deſtroy them that ſpeake lyes. In another place alſo, reckening vp the ſinnes that hinder the ſaluation of men, it doth by name make

Neither doth it that without cauſe, for it directly fighteth with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, which is the truth; contrariwiſe it agreeth with the deuill that is the father of lying.

                           <p>Then is our neighbour loued of vs, when we loue him onely in God, and for Gods cauſe: For, if he bee loued of vs, either becauſe he is our kinſman, or friend, whithout any reſpect to the loue God, that loue is not Chriſtian but naturall, and agreeth vnto brute beaſtes. For this cauſe Chriſt ſaid; If you loue <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 32.</note> them that loue you, what thanke ſhall you haue? for euen ſinners loue thoſe that loue them. Therefore alſo hath hee commaunded the loue of our enemies: for, therein appeareth moſt manifeſtly that whereof wee now ſpeak: That our neighbour is to be loued for God: for an enemie cannot bee loued for his owne ſake, yea rather, he ought to be hated. But when he is conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in God, then he ceaſeth to be an enemy, &amp; is made a neighbour. Euen as therefore all flouds do come out of the ſea, and do fall againe into the ſea: ſo our loue toward our neighbour, ought to begin in God, and to end in God, otherwiſe it is vitious and euill.</p>

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:20291:88"/> in the obiects: for when God ſawe, that himſelfe becauſe he is inuiſible, ſhould hardly bee loued of vs, that doe ſo much cleaue to the loue of things that bee ſeene; hee hath ſet our neighbour before vs as a viſible obiect, in whom he engraued his owne image, that we ſhould worſhip him with ſome part of that loue toward our neighbour, that is wholly due vnto himſelfe; and beſtow vppon our neighbour ſome of thoſe duties and benefites, which by good right doe altogether apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to his Maieſtie.

                     <p>Becauſe iuſtification, and therefore ſaluation goeth before good workes. For, the way which the holy Ghoſt vſeth to make vs able for them, is this, namely, that by faith it ioyneth vs with Chriſt. Whereof Chriſt himſelfe is witneſſe, when he ſaieth; As the branch can <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. 4.</note> beare no fruite of it ſelfe, that is, except it abide in the vine, euen ſo you, except you abide in mee.

                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Imputation is to haue it accompted ours.</note> Therefore by faith being vnited or made one with Chriſt, we are iuſtified and ſaued, by the imputation of his moſt perfect holineſſe &amp; righteouſneſſe, the effects or fruits whereof, be the good works that we do. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, good workes goe not before our iuſtification and ſaluation, but they follow after, as it was well ſaide by one of the ancients; But that which followeth after, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be the cauſe of that which goeth before. By this argument Paule proueth that wee are not iuſtified by <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 8.</note> workes. For he ſaith; You are ſaued by grace, through faith, and that not of your ſelues, it is the gift of God; not of works, leſt any man ſhould boaſt himſelfe. For, we are his workemanſhip, created in Chriſt Ieſus vnto good works, which God hath ordained that we ſhould walke in them. In which words he ſheweth, that good workes cannot be ſaid to be the cauſe of our ſaluation, becauſe they bee done by God himſelfe in vs through Chriſt, after that we be ſaued by faith in him.</p>

                     <p>It is more plaine then the former, namely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe to the end a man may be iuſtified by workes, it is neceſſarily required, that he haue fulfilled the whole Law, and that he be not found ſo much as ſprinkled or wet with any eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the very leaſt ſpot of ſin before God. For, euen as one litle drop of inke, ſtaineth a whole go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blet of cleare water: ſo onely one ſinne is ſufficient to ouerthrow all righteouſneſſe of workes.

Therefore Paul intreating of the way whereby we attaine iuſtification and ſaluation, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth works, not in part, but wholy.

                           <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 28.</note> that a man is iuſtified by faith, without the workes of the law: and in the Chapter following; To him that <note place="margin">

Where he ſheweth, that there is no place for the grace of God, vntill we haue throwne away all truſt and confidence in our owne works: which thing the ſame Apoſtle teſtifieth, that himſelfe did. For, notwithſtanding. concerning the righteouſneſſe which <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 6.</note> is by the law, he were without reproofe, he eſteemed all his good workes as dung, that he might be found not hauing his owne righteouſneſſe, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Chriſt.</p>

                     <pb n="175" facs="tcp:20291:92"/>
                     <p>In the firſt Chapter indeed hee proueth that all the Heathen were full of all vnrighteouſneſſe, fornication, wickedneſſe, couetouſneſſe, &amp; other innumerable ſins. But in the ſecond he ſheweth that the Iewes notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they made a faire ſhew of outward holineſſe, yet were infected &amp; ſtained with the ſame ſins they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in others. Whereupon it is plaine that in that place, there is only mention of moral works and not of the ceremonial. Likewiſe alſo in the Epiſtle to the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathians, where he doth eſpecially entreat of the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, hee alleadgeth both the ſentences of Moyſes, namely the curſe to thoſe that fulfil not the whole law, and life to thoſe that keep it. And in the former indeed hee teacheth, that ſo many as truſt to the workes of the Law to be iuſtified by them, be vnder the curſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot wholly and fully keepe it. But in the other, he declareth that there is ſo much differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the law and faith, that if any man bee iuſtified by faith, hee cannot in any ſort obtaine it by the Law. But it is certain, that as well the curſe threatned to the tranſgreſſors of the Law, as the promiſe to eternal life made to ſuch as fulfill it, are not to be reſtrained to the ceremonies alone, but alſo are to bee referred to the morall Law, and that too by more right: for as much as God (as Hoſea ſaith) preferreth mercy before ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. <note place="margin">

Which wor is do moſt euidently ſhew, that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh not of the ceremoniall works, but of morall, which giue men far more large matter of boaſting then the ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all doe.

                     <p>After that wee be regenerated and therefore made fitte to do good workes, then the Law teacheth vs, whatſoeuer is to be performed of vs, that we may obey God.

Hereunto appertaineth that exhortation of Chriſt; Bee ye perfect, as your father which is in heauen is <note place="margin">

                     <p>I ſay ſo. Euen as fire cannot be without heat, and the Sunne without light. And verily faith of it own <note place="margin">Faith ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not bee without good works.</note> nature bringeth forth good workes.

I doe adde moreouer, that faith can no more ſtand together with an euill conſcience, then water with fire. For it cannot bee, that ſo long as ſinne raigneth in vs, and we willingly offend God, that wee ſhould be aſſured of his loue, ſo as wee may put our whole truſt in him, and repoſe our hope in his fauour and goodneſſe, notwithſtanding that infinite merite of Chriſtes death be knowen and perceiued of vs.</p>

                           <hi>verſ.</hi> 26.</note> ſpirite is dead, euen ſo that faith, that is without good workes is dead, that is, it is not true, but a ſhadow, and a vaine empty likeneſſe of it.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mat.</speaker>
                     <p>I graunt it. For, although the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen be not the wages of ſeruants, but the inheritance of children: yet no man is reckned among the children of God, that is not lead by the ſpirite of God, (as Paul ſpeaketh) <note place="margin">

Howbeit, it ſhall not hurt, ſo as the loue and feare of God go before, if we be allured and drawen on to his ſeruice, by the hope and looking for of the reward. And on the other ſide, be kept and held from diſobeying him, by the feare of

                     <speaker>Theo.</speaker>
                     <p>But ought not the loue of God to be ſufficient, to bring forth that obedience in the harts of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, without borrowing anie other ſpur fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> elſewhere?</p>

                     <p>If our regeneration were perfect, as is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation of them, which liue bleſſedly in heauen, we ſhould know God perfectly, whereby we ſhould be ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp to obey him perfectly: But becauſe there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes behind in vs ſomething not regenerated, which of it owne nature is in bondage, full of ignorance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out loue of God, it is neceſſarie, that we ſhould be ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp to that obedience by the hope of reward: and on the other ſide, by feare of puniſhments be held backe, and kept in obedience. Hereupon it is, that God both rewardeth our good works in this life, according to his promiſes, and alſo correcteth our ſlackneſſe and inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie by diuerſe afflictions which hee ſendeth dayly, whereby it appeareth, that he is true, as well in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, as in the execution of his threatnings.

                     <p n="2"> 2 Becauſe praying one for another, we thinke not to be heard for his ſake that prayeth for vs, which they do, that pray to the Saints departed, &amp; by that meanes giue vnto them the office of Chriſt.</p>

                        <p>We muſt know, that in true prayer we are onely the inſtruments of God, who alone in that as in other good workes, worketh the things that concerne our ſaluation. But that is to be vnderſtood of all the perſons according to the diſtinct proprietie of euery of them. For the holy Ghoſt prayeth in vs, as appeareth by the ſaying of the Apoſtle; The ſpitit maketh requeſt <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 27.</note> for the Saints according to the will of God. The Sonne offereth our prayer to the Father. This prayer the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther receiueth and louingly heareth. Therefore law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and true prayer is that which is made from the heart, the holy Ghoſt ſtirring vs vp, which alſo is directed to the Father in the name of Ieſus Chriſt his Sonne. Indeede we haue an example in the holie Scriptures of a certaine prayer made to the Sonne, in the which this diſtinction of the perſons is not obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: namely in that which Steuen made while hee was ſtoned; Lord Ieſus receiue my ſpirite. Howbeit <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Actes.</hi> 7. 59</note> this example, and if there be any ſuch other, is not contrarie to the rule of right praying. But becauſe we haue begun the expoſition of the Lordes prayer, wee are to returne to the iſſue of the ſpeech wee haue in hand: and it is this, that in this place we be taught, that our prayers muſt be directed to the father, which Paule teſtifieth that himſelfe did in theſe wordes; I bow <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 14.</note> my knees to the father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. We may alſo pray vnto Chriſt, not onely as he is God, but alſo as he is the Mediator, that is, as he is one perſon conſiſting of two natures: yet ſo, as the deity be the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect or the thing which we ſet before our eyes in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Likewiſe alſo we may pray to the holy Ghoſt, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other perſons, who with the Father &amp; the Sonne is very God. And indeede the godly that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in ſuch prayers, do a thing profitable &amp; worthy to be done, ſo as they be not diſtracted with the deepe meditation of the diſtinction of the three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but alwayes haue their minds fixed &amp; ſetled vpon the vnitie of the eſſence. This alſo is to be obſerued, that the name of God is not ſeldome in the Scripture
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:20291:102"/> referred to the whole Godhead. And let theſe things bee ſpoken by the way. For, it is not my purpoſe at this time, to declare all things particularly that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto this place.</p>

For what good doth he by it? Can he change the will of God? No verily. Nay rather hee maketh his own caſe worſe, as well with inward griefe that tormenteth him, as alſo becauſe hee pulleth the wrath of God vpon himſelfe. For by our ſtubburnneſſe he is compelled to lay more grieuous puniſhments v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon vs. On the other ſide, by our patience he is moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vnto pitie, ſo as he turneth our afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s into kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and doing vs good: euen as good parents are wont, when they perceiue, that their children bee brought into good order by their corrections.</p>

                        <p>Thou iudgeſt rightly.

Neuertheleſſe, I will adde vnto them two other beſides, as an ouerplus.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 Firſt, when we be ouerladen with troubles, the euils which we ſuffer are not ſo much to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered, as thoſe which wee haue deſerued, and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding be not laide vpon vs. Furthermore, wee muſt thinke vppon the good things wherewith the Lord la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs on the other ſide: and ſo indeed we ſhall find, that God dealeth moſt mercifully, euen in the middeſt of our troubles, if they bee examined according to the greatneſſe of our ſinnes.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Secondly, that wee are not to looke vpon them onely, which in outward ſhew be a little happier then wee, and whom we ſee to be exempted from the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles wherewith we are grieued: but vpon infinite and innumerable others, which are in farre greater miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, then are thoſe that we ſuffer, whoſe ſins notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding

                        <p>Thou ſpeakeſt wiſely, when thou addeſt the word, <hi>daily.</hi> For the Lord our maſter, that we ſhould not forget this doctrine ſo profitable, is wont often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to beat it into our heads, by ſending of troubles, wherein we might practiſe it. And verily we ought to be well acquainted with it, ſeeing we are ſo often exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in it.</p>

                        <p>But I for my part do find it true, by daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that I am very little exerciſed in it. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, I hope, that by the grace of God, I ſhall profit better in it the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heretofore I haue done: eſpecially, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now I know the way, how I may doe it, namely, to craue it of God by daily prayers, and continually to haue in mind, the things which thou haſt ſayd. But now, for as much as I haue heard the meaning of this third petition, which is the laſt of thoſe that concerne the glorie of God, let vs go forward to the reſt. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I come to the three following, which intreate of our own profit and ſaluation, I would haue thee to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the order of theſe petions, and with it, how fitly they be ioyned together.</p>

                        <p>Finally, in theſe three petitions, we deſire of God, to giue men ſuch knowledge of his Maieſtie, as they may willingly ſubmit themſelues to his kingdome and rule, and from their hearts obey his pleaſure, and ſo be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified of them, and in them.</p>

                        <p>The more diligentlie I conſider the myſterie of our redemption, ſo much the more commeth to my remembrance, the infinite maruellous wiſedome of God, which by a way altogether wonderfull, hath knit or ioyned together his perfect iuſtice with his perfect mercy, and that as well to his owne glory, as to our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation and benefite.</p>

                        <p>True indeed. But if thou do with a litle more
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:20291:109"/> diligence marke that way, thou ſhalt find three things which the reaſon of man could neuer haue deuiſed, and which out of Chriſt are found no where elſe, for the auoyding of the puniſhment due for our ſinnes: and they be theſe: That we ſhould our ſelues pay our debts vnto God: or elſe ſeeke another, which is both able to pay them, and alſo doth acquite vs of them: or that God himſelfe ſhould forgiue vs whatſoeuer we be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted vnto him.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
                        <p>I would haue theſe things declared by thee a little more largely.</p>

                        <speaker>Matth.</speaker>
                        <p>Firſt therefore I will ſhew, that theſe three cannot any where be found, ſauing in Chriſt, And veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whatſoeuer men can imagine, they ſhall neuer find in themſelues wherewith to ſatisfie God. Who alſo (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 32</note> hath ſhut all vnder ſinne, that he might haue mercy vpon all.</p>
                        <p>Neither ſhall they find any creature in heauen or in earth ſufficient to doe this office. But if they flie vnto God his mercy, to obtaine forgiueneſſe of their ſinnes, his perfect iuſtice will be a let, which requireth to be fully ſatisfied.</p>

                        <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
                        <p>Let vs now ſee, how God hath ioyned theſe three things together in Chriſt, to reconcile his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great mercy with his moſt perfect righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, vnto our ſaluation.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Matth.</speaker>
                        <p>Being made one with Chriſt by faith, and therefore alſo partakers of his goods, wee our ſelues pay all our debtes vnto God, and that of the riches of Chriſt, which are truely made ours. And by this meanes the perfect iuſtice of God is fully ſatisfied, which indeed requireth this, that he which oweth the debt ſhould pay it. Neuertheleſſe another hath payd it for vs, namely Chriſt, who alone hath drunke vp the cup of God his wrath, (and as the Apoſtle ſaith) hath <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24</note> borne our ſinnes in his body vpon the tree. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in moſt manifeſtly appeareth the great mercy of God, that gaue his moſt dearely beloued Sonne for vs his enemies vnto a moſt ſhamefull death.</p>
                        <pb n="207" facs="tcp:20291:109"/>
                        <p>Finnally, becauſe he that hath ſatisfied the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father for vs, is his dearely beloued Sonne, &amp; euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting God with the Father, freely giuen vnto vs; the continuall forgiueneſſe of ſinnes (as hath bin ſayd) is ioyned with his ſatisfaction, and that doth eſpecially make ſtedfaſt and ſure his immeaſurable mercy.</p>

                        <p>Verily a notable diſcourſe, and very full of comfort. Let vs now returne to the expoſition of our petition: Why is this clauſe added in the end: as we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue them that treſpaſſe againſt vs?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Matth.</speaker>
                        <p>That is according to the promiſe made vs of the forgiueneſſe of our ſins, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this condition, that we forgiue them that hurt vs. And Chriſt would haue it expreſly mentioned; becauſe he knew how hardly we forgiue others their treſpaſſes. Therefore in this clauſe he calleth vs to remember that wee ſhall not obtaine forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes at the hands of God, except we alſo forgiue our neighbours their offences. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon is that threatning of God by the Prophet againſt the Iſraelites; When you ſhall ſtretch out your hands, <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Iſay.</hi> 1. 15.</note> I will hide mine eyes from you, although you make many prayers I will not heare you: for your hands are full of bloud.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
                        <p>Therefore this manner of ſpeech doth not appoint an equalitie, as if God forgaue vs ſo much, as we ſhall forgiue.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Mat.</speaker>
                        <p>No, not ſo: For, our forgiueneſſe euen as we our ſelues be imperfect, is alwayes imperfect, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth of the vncleanneſſe of our fleſh: whereupon it commeth to paſſe, that euen in them that are moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated, notwithſtanding they doe vnfainedly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue as God requireth, and deſire no reuenge, yea ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be ready to do good vnto ſuch as haue hurt them, and do daily pray for them: yet there remaineth ſome bitterneſſe, ſo as we do not embrace them with that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of heart, which we would haue embraced them with, if we had alwayes beene well pleaſed with them, which if God ſhould do, we were in very ill caſe.</p>
                        <p>Therefore this is the meaning of this petition; ô
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:20291:110"/> Lord according to thy promiſe forgiue vs our ſinnes fully and perfectly, as the moſt perfect God. For as much as we as moſt imperfect men according to thy commandement haue bene fauorable vnto them that haue hurt vs.</p>

                        <p>I grant it is very right, that we ſhould doe thoſe things to our neighbours, which we deſire to be done to ourſelues. And ſo that God doth moſt worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denie them forgiueneſſe, that will not forgiue their neighbours.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Matth.</speaker>
                        <p>True: eſpecially ſeeing our ſinnes againſt God whereof we craue pardon, are farre more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, and farre more in number then are they which our neighbours can euer commit againſt vs. And this doth Chriſt plainly teach, in an excellent parable, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaith; <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 23</note> The kingdome of heauen is like vnto a king, which would demand an account of his ſeruants. And when he began to recken, there was one brought vnto him which ought ten thouſand Talents. And when he was not able to pay it, his Lord commanded him to be ſold, and his wife and children, and all he had, and the debt to be payd. The ſeruant therefore fell downe and beſought him, ſaying; Maſter, appeaſe thine anger to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes me, and I will pay thee all. Then that ſeruants maſter had compaſſion vpon him, and looſed him, and forgaue him the debt: but when the ſeruant was depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, hee found one of his followes that ought him an hundreth pence, and he layd hands vpon him, &amp; tooke him by the throat, ſaying, pay me that thou oweſt. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his fellow fell downe at his feete, and beſought him, ſaying, appeaſe thine anger towards me, and I will pay thee all: yet he would not, but went &amp; caſt him into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:20291:110"/> till he ſhould paie the debt. And when his other fellowes ſaw what was done, they were verie ſory, and came and declared vnto their maiſter all that was done. Then his maiſter called him, and ſaid vnto him: O euill ſeruant, I forgaue thee all that debt, becauſe thou prayedſt me: oughteſt not thou alſo to haue had pitie vppon thy fellow, euen as I had pitie on thee? So his maiſter was wroth, and deliuered him vnto the Iaylers, till hee ſhould pay all that was due vnto him. So likewiſe (ſaieth Chriſt) ſhall mine heauenly Father do vnto you, except ye forgiue from your hearts each one to their brother their treſpaſſes.</p>

                        <p n="2">2 Secondly it ſeemeth ſuperfluous, that we ſhould pray vnto God to ſhew him what things we haue need of, for as much as he knoweth them better then our ſelues: Now it is thy part to anſwere to the former, which concerneth the prouidence of God.</p>

But I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:20291:112"/> a ſtorie, which if I bee not deceiued, will bring light vnto this queſtion. A certaine noble man well furniſhed with horſes, and armour went to warre. Now it fell out that hee tooke his iourney by the houſe of a verie faithfull Paſtor of the Church knowen to him long before. This man gaue not ouer to warne him, to be diligent in prayer, by the which he might mooue the Lord to fauour his enterpriſes. He ſtraight waie reaſoneth concerning the prouidence of God, as if he ſhould haue ſayde, that God had already determined of all things that ſhould come to paſſe: and therefore that his decree could not bee changed by his prayers. That good miniſter aunſwered; I would therefore ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe thee, to ſend away thy horſes and thine armour as things vnprofitable, for as much as the iſſue of warre dependeth vppon the prouidence of God, ſo as no other thing can come to paſſe, beſides that which he determined. The ſouldier anſwered, that ſuch as went to warre could not without raſhneſſe lay aſide their armour, becauſe they were inſtruments, by the which God is woont to giue the victorie to ſuch as it ſeemed good vnto him.

                  <p>When too much is aſcribed to the perſon of him which preacheth the word, it followeth, that the force of preaching is attributed vnto his perſon. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when that is yeelded to men that is due vnto God, men ſpoile the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues of the fruit of the miniſterie.

For euen as heretofore Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias ſucceeded Iudas: that is a holy ſeruant of God a traytor: ſo alſo it hath fallen ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times, that Iudas ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded Matthias, that is ſchiſmatickes and heretickes ſucceeded the moſt faithfull ſeruants of Chriſt. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer there is no teſtimonie in all the Scripture, by the which it can be proued, that that perſonal ſucceſſion is required as neceſſarie to the calling of the Miniſters.

                  <p>To the end we might vnderſtand, that the kingdome of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as we haue declared before) is by the miniſtery of the Church, ſet open to the beleeuers and penitent, and that it is ſhut againſt the vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers and ſtubburne, namely when as by it the former haue their ſinnes forgiuen, that ſo they may come to eternall life: but to the other they be retained, that ſo they may be ſhut from it.

For there is no harder bond then ſinne, foraſmuch as being bound with it, we be held, and indeed willingly, vnder the power and tyrannie of the deuill &amp; death, and it cannot be looſed by any ſtrength of man, but by the onely might of Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, it may be gathered of that, which gaue our Sauiour Chriſt occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſpeake of it: namely, that he might proue the Scribes and Phariſies to be guiltie of that horrible ſin, who ſayd, that the miracles which he did were wrought by the Deuill, whereof notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they were not ignorant that God was the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and Chriſt himſelfe by moſt certaine arguments did declare. And his miracles they did maliciouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayſe in the hatred of his doctrine, which they percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued was manifeſtly confirmed by them. From thence therefore it is plaine, that they ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, that vpon ſet malice ſtand againſt the knowen truth. Ad hereunto that by ſundry places of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it appeareth that euery other ſinne is forgiue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not excepting that which is againſt the doctrine of faith, ſo as it be done of ignorance, as it was with Paul when he perſecuted the Church: or through infirmitie and weakeneſſe, as when Peter denied Chriſt.</p>

For if this had bin his meaning, that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> could haue bin ſaued without Baptiſme, he would haue ſaid thus; But who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſhal not beleeue, or ſhall not be baptized, ſhalbe condemned.

For the bloud of Chriſt in the which we are once Baptized, is neuer drawne dry, but is alwayes freſh, (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh) that is, full of officacie and ſtrength, to the continuall wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing away of all our filthineſſes and iniquities.</p>

Which words do indeed ſignifie no other thing, but that wee ſhould vnderſtand the bread and wine to bee moſt certaine ſignes of our Communion and felowſhip with Chriſts body and bloud.

                  <p>There is one doubt behind within me, which ſeemeth to let, that the godly ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be ſure of their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: namely becauſe thereunto is required, that they be ſure of perſeuerance &amp; continuing to the end, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which Chriſt affirmeth that none ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be ſaued. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe there be many found, which in ſhew begin happily, yea alſo haue long continued in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and confeſſion of the truth, who notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding do ſo fall from it, that they neuer returne.</p>

                  <p>It is true indeed that perſeuerance is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſaluation howbeit the Apoſtle affirmeth; that <note place="margin">

And concerning them that fall away, the words of the Apoſtle be manifeſt; They went out from <note place="margin">1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 19.</note> vs, but they were not of vs: for if they had beene of vs, they ſhould haue continued with vs. But this is done that it might appeare, that all were not of vs. Moreouer they be thoſe of whom Chriſt ſpeaketh, when he ſaith; They which receiued the ſeede (that is the doctrine of the truth of the Goſpel) in ſtony grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, are they which <note place="margin">

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:20291:139"/> they are by and by offended. But they which receiued the ſeede among thornes, are ſuch as he are the word, but the cares of this world and the deceitfulneſſe of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches choaketh the word, and it is made vnfruitefull.</p>

                  <p>Theſe words of Paule are not contraie to that which hath beene ſaid of vs of the happineſſe of the godly euen in this life: for I do not meane a happineſſe that ſtandeth in pleaſures, riches, no nor indeede in earthly commodities, for in theſe for the moſt part they be far gone beyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of the wicked: but rather in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall goods which God giueth vnto vs, namely when we be aſſured of his loue and good will, and that more is, of our ſaluation by Chriſt. I doe therefore thinke with Paule, that of all men wee are moſt miſerable, if there were not hope of a better life, eſpecially conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the afflictions, which we are conſtrained to ſuffer for the profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Goſpell, from the which in the meane time the wicked be free. But on the other ſide, we are of all men moſt happie, when we haue before vs
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:20291:144"/> the aſſurance of the loue and good will of God, &amp; the hope of our ſaluation. For it skilleth little if the wicked excell vs in riches, honour, and other commodities of this life: for they be things vaine and fleeting, which alſo commonlie bring with them more diſprofite then profite. But we contrariwiſe haue ſpirituall riches, that can neuer be taken from vs, which alſo bring with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſound and true ioy, and that euerlaſting. Hereof it is that Paule affirmeth; Godlineſſe is profitable to all <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8</note> things, as that which hath the promiſes of this preſent life, and of that that is to come.

                  <p>The third is this, that the godly haue alwaies an entrance to the mercy of God through Chriſt, and that which more is, by prayers obtaine of him what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is neceſſarie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the wicked are neuer heard.

The wicked contrariwiſe abide ouerwhelmed vnder the burthen of their affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, becauſe they can neuer be aſſured of the loue of God, of whoſe prouidence they be altogether igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant: and therefore be depriued of the ſpirite of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and doe run headlong either into blockiſh ſence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe, or elſe indeed into deſperation. Which things being ſo it is not to bee doubted, but that the ſtate of the faithfull euen in this life, is farre more happy then the ſtate of the wicked.

                  <p>It might haue beene gathered by thee from our diſcourſe, notwithſtanding for memorie ſake, I will in few words repeate it in this place: which is that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clothed by faith with the moſt perfect righteouſnes of Chriſt, wee ſhall finde the tribunall ſeat of God full of mercy and grace, ſo as wee ſhall be receiued into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall glorie, together with Chriſt our head, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and all Saintes, that aſwell of vs as of them God may be praiſed, and we liue happily for euer.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, the wicked being void of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, yea rather infected with innumerable ſinnes, ſhall find the iudgement ſeat of God ſeuere, inſomuch as they ſhall bee ouerwhelmed with the horrible wrath of his iuſt iudgement, and ſhall at length hee caſt into eternall hell fire, where ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth. <note place="margin">The conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</note> Out of theſe things therefore thou maieſt ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that there is no religion worthy of this honorable name, beſide that which is grounded vpon Chriſt: for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as all ſuperſtitions, which teach men not to come to God, but to go away from him, reconcile them not vnto him, but do more and more prouoke him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to wrath, do not only not bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto ſaluation, but do lead them away vnto euerlaſting deſtruction.</p>

                  <p>Hitherto we haue ſufficiently heard of the antitheſis or contrariety betweene religion and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions, and the followers of both. I doe indeed ſee that the Chriſtian Religion is the onely true Religion, and that the followers of it alone are happie and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, whether wee looke to this life, or that that is to come. For all other men are on euerie ſide moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, yea they are more vnhappie then the bruite beaſts, which while they liue be free from all cares, and
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:20291:146"/> after death be deliuered from all labour and paine.</p>

                  <p>I am verily ſufficiently ſatisfied, with this thy holy inſtruction, wherein thou haſt runne ouer all the chiefe points of Chriſtian Religion. Notwithſtanding I will commit them to writing when I haue leyſure, in the order they were deliuered by thee, that both my ſelfe may bee edified and comforted with the reading of them, and that I may communicate them with my brethren. In the meane time I giue thee as great thanks as I can, for the paines which for my ſake thou haſt taken in this behalfe.</p>

                  <p>Nay rather let vs giue thanks vnto God our heauenly Father, that hath giuen vnto vs this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth, and hath granted that we haue bene able to declare it. Let vs alſo intreat him, that as this <note place="margin">The ſumme of the duety of Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</note> truth is grounded only in Ieſus Chriſt his ſonne: ſo by the power of the holy Ghoſt it may bee grafted in our minds, that we may ſincerely beleeue it with the hart, conſtantly confeſſe it with the mouth, and expreſſe the effects of it by outward works, euen to our laſt breath. Which that it may be, hee grant vs this alſo, that wee may ioyne our ſelues to the militant Church, and by the miniſtery thereof be confirmed in the loue &amp; feare of God, that ſo we may at length be receiued into the triumphant Church, together with our head and Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>I doe therefore pray thee (moſt mightie God and heauenly Father) to grant vs theſe benefits, and to cauſe that the knowledge of thy truth may bee ſpread abroad throughout all the world, that al may acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thee the only true God, &amp; Ieſus Chriſt thy Son the only Sauiour and Mediator of mankinde. And to thee alone be praiſe and glorie both now and for euer.</p>
